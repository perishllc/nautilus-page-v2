      <p>
        This Nautilus Mobile Application End User License Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a binding agreement
        between you ("<strong>End User</strong>," "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>") and
        <strong>Perish LLC </strong>("<strong>Perish</strong>",<strong> </strong>"
        <strong>we</strong>", <strong>"our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>"). This Agreement governs your use on your
        mobile device of the compiled, executable <strong>Nautilus </strong>mobile application released by us, and all
        related documentation (collectively, the " <strong>Application</strong>").
      </p>
      <p>
        The Application is licensed (not sold) to you, pursuant to and subject to your compliance with the terms and
        conditions of this Agreement.

        <strong><u>DISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ THIS FIRST</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        THE APPLICATION IS OWNED, OPERATED AND RELEASED BY PERISH ONLY. PERISH IS INDEPENDENT OF,
        AND OPERATES SEPARATELY FROM, THE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING, OPERATING, MAINTAINING OR SUPPORTING THE NANO
        PROTOCOL, THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK, THE NANO CURRENCY OR ANY SOFTWARE WALLET THAT IS NOT RELEASED BY
        PERISH (COLLECTIVELY, "<strong>SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES</strong>"). FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, PERISH LLC
        DOES NOT OWN, DEVELOP, OPERATE, MAINTAIN OR SUPPORT ANY OF THE SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES.

      <p>
        PERISH IS NOT A BANK, CUSTODIAN OR OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANY AND DOES NOT PROVIDE BANKING, CUSTODIAL OR
        OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES. THE APPLICATION IS NOT A BANKING, CUSTODIAL OR OTHER SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE
        APPLICATION AND YOUR CREATION AND ACCESSING OF A WALLET ON THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK (A
        "<strong>WALLET</strong>") USING THE APPLICATION DOES NOT INVOLVE THE OPENING, ESTABLISHING OR MANAGING OF AN
        "ACCOUNT" WITH PERISH; INSTEAD, YOU ARE SIMPLY USING THE APPLICATION TO INTERACT WITH THE NANO BLOCK
        LATTICE NETWORK AND YOUR WALLET/ACCOUNTS ON THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK.
      </p>
      <p>
        A "<strong>WALLET SEED</strong>" IS A UNIQUE CODE THAT IS PROVIDED TO YOU BY THE APPLICATION, THROUGH ITS DIRECT
        INTERACTION WITH THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK (I.E., WITHOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT) WHEN YOU FIRST CREATE A NEW WALLET
        USING THE APPLICATION. YOUR WALLET SEED IS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO RECOVER YOUR WALLET ON THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE
        NETWORK AND ACCESS ANY NANO CURRENCY YOU STORE IN THAT WALLET.
      </p>
      <p>
        WE DO NOT RECEIVE, COLLECT, RECORD, STORE OR HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR WALLET SEED. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT RECOVER IT FOR
        YOU IF YOU LOSE IT AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCESS TO ANY NANO CURRENCY THAT YOU STORE IN YOUR WALLET. YOU
        ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RECORDING YOUR WALLET SEED IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE AND MANNER. DO NOT SHARE YOUR
        WALLET SEED WITH ANYONE, OR PERMIT ANYONE TO USE YOUR MOBILE DEVICE ON WHICH THE APPLICATION IS INSTALLED WHO YOU
        DO NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR WALLET OR YOUR NANO CURRENCY.
      </p>
      <p>
        ANY NANO CURRENCY THAT YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS, HOLD, STORE, MANAGE, RECEIVE, SEND OR TRANSMIT USING THE APPLICATION,
        AND ANY BALANCE AND TRANSACTION INFORMATION RELATING TO IT, ARE NEVER ACCESSED, HELD, STORED, MANAGED, RECEIVED,
        SENT OR TRANSMITTED BY PERISH.
      </p>

      <p>
        YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, YOUR NANO CURRENCY, AND YOUR WALLET SEED. PERISH
        IS NOT AND WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE SECURITY OR PROTECTION OF YOUR NANO CURRENCY
        OR WALLET SEED.
      </p>
      <p>
        YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND PERISH DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS,
        WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE SECURITY, COMPATIBILITY, SUITABILITY OR RELIABILITY OF THE APPLICATION OR
        ANY NANO CURRENCY THAT YOU ACCESS, HOLD, STORE, MANAGE, RECEIVE, SEND OR TRANSMIT USING THE APPLICATION.
